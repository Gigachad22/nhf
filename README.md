# JGraphs - End-of-Semester project for my first Java course

This application can handle weighted, undirected graphs. It allows basic operations on graphs such as inserting vertices and edges.
Additionally, it can run BFS and Dijkstra algorithms, and their results are displayed in a new window. Graph objects can also be serialized to a file and later deserialized.

The graphical user interface is implemented using the Swing framework following the MVC model.
